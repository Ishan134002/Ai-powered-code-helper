# Ai-powered-code-helper
Code Helper is a smart Chrome extension designed to assist developers in solving complex coding problems more efficiently. It uses Google Studio AI (Gemini/PaLM) to analyze problem statements from popular coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and more, providing context-aware hints in real time.
The extension captures the content of coding problems directly from the active tab, processes it using AI, and displays intelligent hints to guide users toward the solution‚Äîwithout giving away the full answer. This promotes learning and deep problem-solving skills.
